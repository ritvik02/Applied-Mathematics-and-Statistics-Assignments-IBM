    "(sometimes called the Wilcoxon rank-sum test) is used to compare the differences between two samples when the sample distributions are not normally distributed and the sample sizes are small (n <30). It is considered to be the nonparametric equivalent to the two sample t-test. Researchers want to know if a fuel treatment leads to a change in the average mpg of a car. To test this, they measure the mpg of 12 cars with the fuel treatment and 12 cars without it. Since the sample sizes are small and the researchers suspect that the sample distributions are not normally distributed, they decided to perform a Mann-Whitney U test to determine if there is a statistically significant difference in mpg between the two groups"
